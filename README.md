# Auto-correct text
Correcting typos in a word based on the frequency dictionary.

This algorithm is based on the distance between words according to the Levenshtein-Damerau algorithm, and the frequency of words in the language.

There is a choice of three functions for calculating the best option: linear, exponential and power function. The parameters for these functions are user-definable.
